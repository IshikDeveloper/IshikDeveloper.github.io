    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
Welcome!
Hello! I'm Adam, a Small Roblox Dev based in Iraq. With a passion for RNG, I have dedicated my career to make an succsecful game like Sol's RNG.

My Journey
My journey began in 2020, where I just watched tutorial videos and used toolbox models. Over the years, I have created some games.

What I Do
As a Roblox Dev, I specialize in Modeling, Scripting. My work involves Modeling Animating Scripting. Some of the projects I’ve worked on include:

Ducky's RNG
The Weirdest Folder
[Comming Soon]
My Philosophy
I believe in myself. This belief drives me to acheving all the golden crown of o's.

Beyond Work
When I'm not Scripting, you can find me play other roblox Games. Whether it’s Obby Creator, Ducky's RNG, or FNFMA, I always find joy in listening to my communities suggestions.</p>
